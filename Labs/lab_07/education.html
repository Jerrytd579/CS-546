                I don't know if I could say I had a single most memorable college memory, but for sure some of the most fun I had throughout my
                college experience would be the multiple instances in which I spent time hanging out with some of the friends I made here at 
                Stevens. Whether it be going out to eat with friends, or pulling over-nighters to study for exams, the best parts of my college
                experience so far would have to be through the connections to other people that I have made during the experience. I can imagine
                this is the same for many other people, and this is one of the primary reasons why COVID-19 has been so rough to so many others here at Stevens.

                So my most memorable memory that comes from high school happens to be pretty long, so I'll describe it in my story.html page. However,
                another memorable experience I had in high school would be when I helped found my school's robotics club. Being part of my school's robotics
                club was the first experience I ever had with Computer Programming, and it was through this experience that I realized that I wanted to
                make programming my profession. My robotics club didn't have much, if any success in the competitions we competed in. That being said,
                after I graduated, my school's robotics club ended up winning several events, and were able to compete at the statewide/national level
                (I don't quite remember), so you could say I helped to lay the foundation for that success. At least, that's what I like to tell myself :)
