            Like I describe in my education page, here is my most memorable high school memory. What is it, you ask? 
            In short: the times I came to school basically cosplaying as Kim Jong Un. Yeah, I'm serious. Yeah, times, plural.

        <p>
            Specifically, this occurred on two separate instances: a halloween dress up contest, and the annual Rent-A-Senior contest. I'll explain what the latter is further down.
        </p>

        <p>
            So basically, my senior year, there was a halloween dress up contest. A group of myself and my friends planned on dressing up in suits and ties and entering the group contest as mafia gang. Turns out,
            I forgot to come into school wearing a suit. Luckily, I was wearing a green polo shirt. So one of my friends gave me his suit jacket, and instead of doing mafioso gang, we were Kim Jong Jerry (Un) and his body guards.
            I put on a, in hindsight, extremely offensive Korean accent, and we rolled with it. We actually ended up winning the group contest, even though we literally weren't wearing any fancy costumes. But the story we spun
            up was apparently funny enough for everyone to vote on it, and ultimately, my group ended up winning the group contest.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second time I dressed up as Kim Jong Un occurred during Rent-A-Senior. Basically, what it is is once a year, the day before winter break, the underclassmen get to rent a senior for a day. They get to make the senior do pretty much anything, as long
            as its reasonable. Things like carrying the underclassman's bag around, driving them to school, buying them WaWa, et cetera. Auctions for seniors typically occur the week before. Half the proceeds
            go to charity, and the other half to the student government, which is stockpiled to help fund future student-run events.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Anyway, part of the rent a senior auctioning process is that the would-be auctioned off senior gets to briefly advertise themselves before they go up for auction. So what I did was I took a North Korean propaganda speech praising Kim Jong Un, translated it to English, and recited it.
            I don't quite recall what the speech itself was, but I remember it had something to do with praising Kim Jong Un and the nuclear weapons program. I remember this because a friend of mine let me borrow his model rocket, and I had used that
            as proof of the 'success' of my nuclear weapons program. This was also around the time when the whole world was reacting to North Korea's nuclear weapons program a few years ago, so I guess part of what
            made the whole thing interesting was how relevant it was at the time. I also handed out flyers of generic propaganda, but with my face photoshopped over it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anyhow, in doing so, I ended up breaking the school's previous record for most expensive auction by a landslide. Basically, it works like an auction, where students try to outbid each other.
            The previous highest record was something around $140. I ended up being auctioned off for $235.
        </p>

        <p>
            Something that I would like to note: on the actual day in which I would be the underclassman's servant for a day, said underclassman who rented me didn't actually make me do anything for them.
            So basically they threw away 200 bucks for me to do nothing for them. But hey, money to charity is money to charity.
